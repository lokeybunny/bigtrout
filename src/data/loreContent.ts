      'A mysterious creator (who remains shadowy to this day) launched $BIGTROUT on Pump.fun, inspired by the trader known as @BigTrout300 – a down-to-earth, retail-turned-trader guy who calls himself "A Trader That Is A Trout." His bio? Simple. Relatable. He\'s the intern at BitFinex, shares anon tips, and keeps his space friendly and fun for everyone.',
      'This creator didn\'t just make a random coin. They modeled it after BigTrout\'s whole vibe – the hardworking trader who grinded through years of $20 frozen pizzas, minimum credit card payments, retail electronics jobs, and finally breaking even (or making minor profits) in trading. No whales, no hidden agendas – just a genuine dude helping little traders 24/7.',

He had zero involvement in the launch at first – didn\'t create it, didn\'t promote it, didn\'t even know it existed until his DMs exploded and fees started flowing in.',
      'Picture this: One day he\'s just tweeting charts and helping folks, next thing – boom – a memecoin bearing his name is live, and money\'s pouring into his wallet from creator fees. Shaking, sweating, and totally conflicted, he jumped on X to be 100% transparent.',

      'Instead of dumping or extracting, he used those fees to buy back $BIGTROUT and hold it for the community. He locked up massive chunks of his own supply – first around $70K worth near ATHs, then all his ~45,000,000 tokens (valued over $100K at points) for a full year. Proof? On-chain, trackable wallets shared openly.',

      'He looped fees through DLMM pools, added liquidity manually (even with whale help), and kept everything transparent. Asked the community: "Where should we list next?" – no shady OTC deals allowed. Teamed up with Moonshot for spotlight features and easy mobile trading. Ran giveaways to spread the love and encourage holding.',
